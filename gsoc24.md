tagline: Welcome to the C2SI Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2024 project ideas page. 
---

This is the 6th time that we are participating in the GSoC, we will use this page to develop possible project ideas that have on the above mentioned areas. Please note that anyone who is interested can participate in this process. You do not have to be a GSoC student or mentor to suggest possible project ideas.
<br><br>
You can also talk to us about possible project ideas and we are happy to improve or heip you with them. Please keep in mind that projects need to be realistically something that is able to be functionally completed by a student working full time for about eight weeks. Thanks!

## Important Guidelines on Submitting Ideas

*There are some important guidelines to submit ideas, please read these carefully before adding your ideas!*

1. There is a fixed time period for implementing and coding your ideas.
2. Come up with attainable goals and you will be able to complete what you set out to do. You can always contact our mentors and community and get an idea about the workload and whether you might be able to complete them.
3. You are free to come up with your own ideas. The ideas should be about Internet of Things (IOT), Computer Security and Software Tools. Also if you love to work on any of these subjects but do not have an idea you can always contact us.
4. Lets Talk! The best way to solve problems that you might have is to contact our mentors and also our community.
5. We encourage you to do documentation so that we can keep track of your progress and also help you if things are not going according to plan. Although not compulsory we have a strong belief that this method can cut down your time to code and also the workload of the mentors drastically.
6. Please send your new project ideas to gsoc[at]c2si.com

# Idea List for 2024
*The following is the idea list for Google Summer of Code 2023*

## Example Project

Project 1
: Complete the tasks in Road Map of Dunner up to v1.0
<br><br>

Brief explanation
: Dunner is a task runner tool like Grunt but used Docker images as CircleCI does. You can define tasks and steps of the tasks in your `.dunner.yaml` file and then run these steps with `Dunner do taskname`.
<br><br>

We have several features planned in our road map, we need you to complete them one issue by one. See the list of features planned for v0.1 and v1.0 below.
* v0.1: <https://github.com/leopardslab/Dunner/milestone/2>
* V1.0: <https://github.com/leopardslab/Dunner/milestone/1>
<br><br>

Expected results
: At the end of your summer, we expect that you will complete all the features planned up to v1.0. Also, you have to improve the wikis which are related to your development areas. Come up with a plan of what features you are gonna do when as a timeline. Consider improving the wikis also in your timeline.
Knowledge Prerequisite: Go Programming Language, Docker, some idea about Task Runners, Linux
<br><br>

Mentor
: Milindu Kumarage, Pratik Dhanave
<br><br>

---------------------------

## 2: ProjectExplainer: Add knowledge graph based retrieval and explanation APIs for code and text modalities in documentation.

Brief explanation
: ProjectExplainer project is a set of tools to help with explaining code repositories using large language models.
<br><br>
At this point, ProjectExplainer supports a small set of API’s to provide summarization or explanation capabilities over GitHub based code repositories by parsing through readme’s and pulling important pieces of information which is then provided as prompt to an LLM to produce summarization.
<br><br>
With this GSoC project, we wish to include knowledge graphs to embed GitHub repository code and text  modalities to use that as a retrieval interface for the LLM to perform summarization/explanation task.
<br><br>

Expected Results
: At the end of the GSoC term, we expect integration of knowledge graphs for both text and code modalities and expose another set of API’s for summarization or explanation tasks.
<br><br>

Required Knowledge
: Python, Neo4j, Large Language Models, Hugging Face, Pytorch, Knowledge Graphs.
<br><br>

Possible Mentors
: Mehant Kammakomati
<br><br>
