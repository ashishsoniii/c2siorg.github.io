title: GDB UI
---

Brief explanation 
: GDB stands for GNU Debugger. It's a powerful and popular debugger for various programming languages, including C, C++, Ada, and others. It allows developers to observe what a program is doing while it's running. This is particularly useful when debugging to find and fix problems in the code.
<br><br>
GDB consists of rich and powerful features like 
<br>+ Start and stop the execution of the program., Examine the state of the program (variables, registers, memory, etc.), etc. 
<br><br>
GDB (GNU Debugger) is operational within the terminal. Our goal of this project involves crafting a user interface (UI) using React, designed specifically to communicate with the GDB Python API. This UI aims to construct a dashboard facilitating interaction via the GDB Python API interface. to serve as a user-friendly platform enabling the execution of commands and operations through the GDB Python UI.
